	<h3>Absolute Minimum</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
		In this section, we will take a look at the internal workings of a generic Linux system, fish out the core
		components required, and build our own minimum system from scratch.
	</p>

	<h3>Boot Process</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
		Understanding how does a Linux system starts and what components are loaded at which
		stage is vital for ensuring the proper functionality of our own mini system.

		<ol>
			<li>
				BIOS gets loaded into RAM from the motherboard, looks for the 1st
				bootable device it finds (hard drive, CD-ROM, etc), then it loads the
				bootloader (grub, syslinux, ...) installed on that device.
				<br> <br>
			</li>

			<li>
				The bootloader then loads the kernel image (vmlinuz/bzImage) into memory
				and then passes the control over to the running kernel. <br> <br>
			</li>

			<li>
				The kernel mounts the root file system, then executes a userspace program
				to initialize the system, which is usually /sbin/init.
				<br> <br>
			</li>

			<li>
				/sbin/init is the first userspace process that the kernel launches and its
				PID is always 1. This process cannot exit during the runtime of the system
				or else you will end up with a kernel panic (when the kernel runs into an
				fatal error). <br>

				All other userspace processes are descendants of init, and all orphaned 
				processes are automatically adopted by init. <br>

				Commonly, init reads /etc/inittab in order to carry out specific initialization
				tasks, such as loading modules, mounting disks, running other scripts, starting
				daemon processes, etc. <br> <br>
			</li>

			<li>
				/sbin/init can now open terminals or start a graphical user interface for the
				user to use.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>


	<h3>Constructing the System</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
		Visite <a href="https://www.kernel.org">kernel.org</a> and click on the yellow button
		saying "Latest Stable Kernel" to download the Linux kernel source code. Then create a
		working directory in your home folder named "build" and copy the downloaded tarball into the build folder. Rename the tarball "kernel.tar.xz"
		and untar it:
	</p>
	<code>
		$ xz -d kernel.tar.xz <br>
		$ tar -xf kernel.tar <br>
		$ rm kernel.tar <br>
	</code>
	<p>
		Remove the tarball, then rename the decompressed folder to "kernel" and change directory into it.
	</p>
	<code>
		$ cd kernel
	</code>
	<p>
		Clean the source code folder of any leftovers from previous builds:
	</p>
	<code>
		$ make mrproper
	</code>
