	<h3>Home</h3>
	<p>
		The <i>Micro</i>Linux project will guide you through the process of building a functional
		yet compact Linux system from scratch. The result is a bootable disk image that
		contains a custom Linux kernel, musl libc, a service manager, a lightweight shell,
		and around 150 common system utilities in roughly 6MB of space.
	</p>
	<h3>Why?</h3>
	<p>
		Initially, <i>Micro</i>Linux started out as a personal project to develop a tiny Linux system
		that uses as little disk space and RAM as possible (intended as a Xen hypervisor guest).
		However, most of the articles/documentation out there is severely outdated (written way
		back in 2005) and sometimes there were no docs to read at all (such as how to configure
		a Linux kernel). I had to build the system using trial-and-error, and as a result, I
		learned quite a lot about the internals of Linux. The entire process was very tedious
		and challenging, so I thought it would be good to share my experience.
	</p>
	<h3>Getting Started</h3>
	<p>
		The <i>Micro</i>Linux <a href="wiki.html">Wiki</a> is where all the tutorials, guides, and documentation
		are stored. Check out the Wiki to start building your own <i>Micro</i>Linux!
