	<h3>Home</h3>
	<p>
		The <i>Micro</i>Linux project will guide you through the process of building a 
		functional yet compact Linux system from scratch. The result is a bootable disk image
		that contains a custom Linux kernel, musl libc, a service manager, a lightweight shell,
		and around 200 common system utilities in roughly 6MB of space.
	</p>
	<h3>Why?</h3>
	<p>
		Initially, <i>Micro</i>Linux started out as a personal project to develop a tiny Linux
		system that uses as little disk space and RAM as possible (intended as a Xen hypervisor
		guest). However, most of the documentation online is either severely outdated or 
		nonexistent (such as configuring the Linux kerenl). The process was very challenging,
		so I thought it would be good to share my experience.
	</p>
	<h3>Getting Started</h3>
	<p>
		The <i>Micro</i>Linux <a href="wiki.html">Wiki</a> is where all the tutorials
		and documentation are stored. Check out the Wiki to start building your own
		<i>Micro</i>Linux!
