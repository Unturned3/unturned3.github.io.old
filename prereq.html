	<h3>Skill requirements</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
		Building a Linux system from the ground up is not a trivial task, and it requires familiarity
		with the Linux command line (shell). As a minimum, you should be able to do basic command line
		operations such as copying/moving/renaming files, changing/listing directories, printing file
		contents, deleting files, creating files/directories, etc. You are also expected to edit files
		from the command line, using a text editor such as GNU Nano or Vi/Vim.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you've never worked with the command line or Linux in general, I suggest you to visit
		<a href="http://linux-tutorial.info">linux-tutorial.info</a> to learn some basic knowledge first.
	</p>
	<p>
		You also need to know the basic of software compilation (such as using gcc, make, etc.). Here's
		good website about the subject:

	<h3>Host requirements</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>
		You need to have a working Linux environment (Ideally a mainstream distribution such as
		Debian or Arch) setup on your machine. It can either be a bare-metal hard drive install
		or can be in a virtual machine. It needs to have at least 2GB of RAM and 15GB of free
		disk space in order to build all the packages.
	</p>

	<p> Here's a list of extra packages you need to install on your system: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> <b>gcc</b> (The GNU compiler collection)</li>
		<li> <b>make</b>  (a build tool that simplifies the compilation process for users</li>
		<li> <b>bc</b> (needed for the building of the Linux kernel)</li>
		<li> <b>qemu</b> (Quick Emulator, used to run and test <i>Micro</i>Linux</li>
		<li> <b>ncurses</b> (a menu interface for configuration scripts)</li>
		<li> <b>gawk</b> (a text-processing language) </li>
	</ul>
